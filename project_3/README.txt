Static Type Checker
==

## Introduction

Type checking is the processes of identifying errors in a program based on explicitly or implicitly stated type information. Implementing a static type checker for your C subset. The checker needs to:
* Create a symbol table
* Insert the type of each variable into the symbol table.
* Perform the type checking for each expression.

## Requirements

antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar
openjdk 14.0.1

You should execute this program in Linux or Unix-like system

## Setup

 1. Locate the project folder 406410035_prj3_v1
 2. Check you have java jdk installed in your environment
 3. Check if antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar is working in your environmnet by typing `java -jar antlr-3.5.2-complete.jar`. If not working you must download it from ANTLR website and put it in the project folder
 4. type `make`
 5. The testing result will be shown on both the screen and the files in the project folder
    * test1.c -> test1_result.txt
    * test2.c -> test2_result.txt
    * test3.c -> test3_result.txt

## C Test Programs

1. test1.c: Test basic variable declaration
2. test2.c: Test nested if, else if, else and printf statements
3. test3.c: Test nested for, while, if statements
